## 💡 Part 1: What is XS Classic (XSC)?
- Imagine it’s 2014–2015. SAP HANA is gaining popularity. Now, you want to build apps on top of your SAP HANA database. SAP provides you something called XS Classic (XSC).

## 🧱 What is XS Classic?

1. Think of XSC as a small web server built inside the HANA database.
2. You can write business logic using JavaScript and store it directly in the database.
3. You write files like .xsjs, .xsodata, .hdbtable, etc., and deploy them inside the HANA database.

## 🚫 But what’s the issue?

1. You’re mixing everything together: code, database, web server — all in one place.
2. Not suitable for enterprise-grade scaling (like CI/CD, team collaboration).
3. No concept of containers or microservices.
4. Security concerns, hard to manage users/roles at scale.
5. So eventually… people hit limitations.

## 🔁 Part 2: Migration from XS Classic to XS Advanced (XSA)

- SAP said: "Okay, time for an upgrade!" Enter XS Advanced (XSA).

### 🛠️ What is XSA?

XSA is based on Cloud Foundry, a modern application platform.
1. Now your code is outside the HANA database, running in its own container.
2. You can use modern languages like Node.js, Java, etc.
3. Full support for microservices, role-based access, DevOps tools, etc.

### 🎯 Why move from XSC to XSA?

## XS Classic (XSC)     	XS Advanced (XSA)
Code + DB = Same place	    Code and DB = Separated
Old-school architecture  	Modern microservice-based
Harder to scale	            Easier to scale & maintain
Limited DevOps           	CI/CD friendly

So teams started migrating to XSA.
